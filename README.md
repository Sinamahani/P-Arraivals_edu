Seismic Wave Propagation Simulation


This repository contains Python code that simulates the propagation of seismic waves through one layer of the Earth using synthetic seismic signals. The code employs the numpy library for numerical operations, scipy.signal for generating the Ricker wavelet, and matplotlib for visualization.

Key Features:

Simulates the propagation of seismic waves through a layered medium.
Generates synthetic seismic signals based on specified parameters.
Visualizes the waveforms as they travel through the Earth's layers.
